# Hopfield

This repo concerns the code that i've been writing for work with Hopfield Networks. In particular, I am interested in the work of the relaxing Hopfield Network (rHN) with learning applied. In this repo you will find the underlying code I use to produce models and notebooks that demonstrate the properties of these models.

## rHN-0.ipynb

This notebook demonstrates the behaviour seen by the rHN-0 model.
